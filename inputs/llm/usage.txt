This is the section Data-Method:

Our analysis commenced with the essential task of refining the raw dataset. The initial phase involved cleaning and standardizing the dataset's variable names to enhance readability and analytical efficiency. We also aggregated the data to quantify the prevalence of each cause of death, thereby streamlining the dataset for more focused analysis. A critical aspect of our methodology was the isolation of data from the year 2019. This strategic choice was made to examine mortality trends immediately before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. By focusing on this specific year, we aimed to establish a baseline understanding of mortality patterns unaffected by the pandemic's impact. Within this scope, as showing in @tbl-causes, we identified and prioritized the top 8 causes of mortality, based on their significance and prevalence.

Building on the refined dataset, our analysis further narrowed to investigate the top 5 causes of mortality in 2019. This deliberate focus allowed us to concentrate our efforts on the most impactful health challenges faced by Alberta before the pandemic. We applied statistical models to fit these mortality trends, seeking to identify underlying patterns and determinants. This approach was aimed at uncovering insights that could inform public health strategies and interventions, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of mortality dynamics in the province.

what about this paragraph, also in the method section:

The choice of models was Possion and Negative Binomial. As for the reasons of choosing these two models, the Poisson and Negative Binomial models are integral in the analysis of mortality data due to their intrinsic alignment with the nature of count data. Mortality counts, representing the number of deaths within specified timeframes, inherently follow the discrete distribution that the Poisson model assumes. This model presumes the mean and variance of the distribution to be equal, a premise that often holds true for data representing events occurring independently over a constant period. Its utility is further enhanced by the interpretability of its parameters; the exponential coefficients represent the change in the mortality rate for a unit change in the predictor, offering direct insights into the impact of various factors on mortality rates. Such clarity is indispensable for researchers and policymakers seeking to derive actionable conclusions from statistical findings.However, real-world data, including those related to mortality rates, often exhibit overdispersion, where the observed variance surpasses the mean. This deviation from the Poisson assumption necessitates a model that can accommodate such irregularity, which is where the Negative Binomial model becomes relevant. It extends the Poisson model by incorporating an additional parameter to account for overdispersion, thereby offering a more flexible fit for datasets that display greater variability.

Your paragraph provides a detailed rationale for selecting the Poisson and Negative Binomial models in your analysis, explaining their relevance to mortality data. However, the paragraph could benefit from a bit of streamlining for clarity and conciseness, and minor adjustments for readability. Here’s a revised version:

The choice of models for our analysis was the Poisson and Negative Binomial. These models are particularly suited for mortality data analysis, aligning well with the characteristics of count data. Mortality counts, which represent the number of deaths over specific periods, naturally follow the discrete distribution assumed by the Poisson model. This model assumes equal mean and variance, a condition that typically applies to independent events occurring at a constant rate. The Poisson model is valued for the interpretability of its parameters; its exponential coefficients reflect the change in mortality rate per unit change in a predictor, providing clear insights into factors influencing mortality rates. This clarity is crucial for deriving actionable insights from the data.

However, mortality data often exhibit overdispersion—where the variance exceeds the mean—challenging the Poisson model’s assumption. The Negative Binomial model addresses this by introducing an extra parameter to handle overdispersion, making it a more adaptable choice for analyzing data with greater variability.

Changes made:

Condensed the explanation of why the Poisson and Negative Binomial models were chosen to make the paragraph more concise.
Clarified the description of how the models relate to mortality data for improved readability.
Streamlined the discussion of the models' advantages and the rationale for their selection to enhance the flow of information.

only check for grammar mistakes now:

Then to see how good two models fits the original data. We can reffer to the values in the lower half of @tbl-summary, but it's always more clear to see the visual, as depicted by the graphs for the Poisson (@fig-models-1) and negative binomial models (@fig-models-2), the diagnostic plots further elucidate the model fits. The spread of the simulated lines (y_rep) around the Prediction data (y) suggests that the negative binomial model may accommodate the overdispersion present in the data, which is a common characteristic in count data such as mortality rates.

The presence of multiple peaks in the simulated data distributions of @fig-models-2 indicates potential subgroups within the data or non-linearity in the mortality trends that the Poisson model may not be accounting for. Such patterns underscore the importance of considering different model structures when dealing with complex datasets. The negative binomial model, appears to capture the dispersion in the data more effectively than the Poisson model, which is evident in two plots. Futhermore, this better prediction by negative binomial model was consistent with the prediction for two models mentioned in the method part of @sec-data.
